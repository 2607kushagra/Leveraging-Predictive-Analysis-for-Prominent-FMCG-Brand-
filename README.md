**Overview:**
The goal of this project is to develop data-driven solutions to assist Conagra in unlocking growth
potential in the Tablespreads category. Conagra Brands is devoted to driving innovation and
growth in its product portfolio as one of the leading packaged food companies in the United
States. Conagra's Tablespreads category, which includes butter, margarine, and spreads, is a
significant focus area for the corporation, and the company is trying to optimize its existing
brands and discover new development potential within this category.
To accomplish this goal, our team performed a thorough examination of market trends, customer
behavior, and the competitive environment in the Tablespreads category. To acquire insights into
the factors that drive the Tablespreads market and discover new growth prospects, we will
leverage a combination of data sources, including IRi's Point of Sales and Panel data and NPD's
National Eating Trends data. Advanced analytics approaches, such as predictive modeling will
also be used to forecast future demand and establish focused marketing and product development
plans.

**Objective:**
The project's findings will assist Conagra in developing a data-driven strategy that will aid
product development, pricing, and marketing in the Tablespreads sector. Conagra will be able to
optimize its existing portfolio of Tablespreads brands and explore new product development
options that fit consumers' shifting demands and preferences by harnessing consumer insights
and market trends. Finally, the success of this project will allow Conagra to acquire a larger
portion of the Tablespreads market and drive long-term sustainable growth.
